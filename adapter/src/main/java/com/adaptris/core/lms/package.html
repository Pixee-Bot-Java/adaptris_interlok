<p>AdaptrisMessage implementation that supports arbitarily large
messages.</p>
<p>The AdaptrisMessage implementation is backed by a pair of files;
there is minor support for the existing {@link
com.adaptris.core.AdaptrisMessage#getPayload()} and {@link
com.adaptris.core.AdaptrisMessage#getStringPayload()} methods, however,
RuntimeExceptions will be thrown if there is an attempt to use those
methods on files above a certain size as determined by {@link
com.adaptris.core.lms.FileBackedMessageFactory#getMaxMemorySizeBytes()}.
Generally speaking you should be using {@link
com.adaptris.core.AdaptrisMessage#getInputStream()} and {@link
com.adaptris.core.AdaptrisMessage#getOutputStream()} to read and write
from the payload respectively.</p>
