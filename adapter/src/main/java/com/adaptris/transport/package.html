Revision 1.1  2002/09/11 08:54:37  lchan
JDK1.4 is required :-
TransportException is a JDK1.4 Exception
SSLSocketTransport is now JDK1.4 compliant i.e. JSSE1.4 compatible
Comments do not generate warnings in javadoc 1.4
Moved overview to be package level documentation

If JDK1.3.1 compatibility is required, then
TransportException should extend com.adaptris.util.AdaptrisChainedException
and some of the comments in SSLSocketTransport should be removed.

Revision 1.1  2002/07/24 21:15:57  lchan

<body>
<p>The Adaptris Transport package contains all the relevant code used
to handle a direct connection to a remote machine.
<p>The default implementation is a TCP/IP socket.  This can be either a normal
plain socket, or a SSL/TLS socket implementation.  Further implementations such as
a direct MODEM connection, or X.25 connection are available.
<p>Use of the TLS implementation does require JSSE 1.0.2 compliant
jars to be available in the classpath. An attempt is made to add the default
<b>Sun</b> JSSE 1.0.2 provider - <code>com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider()</code> 
but no logging of this attempt (or failure) is made.  More information about
JSSE can be found <a href='http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/'>here</a>
<p>The formal specificiation for TLS can be found on the internet draft
<a href='http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2246.html'>RFC2246</a>
